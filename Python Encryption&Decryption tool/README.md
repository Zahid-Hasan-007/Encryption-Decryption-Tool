# Drive-Encryptor-Decryptor
This project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting files and directories on your computer's drive. It utilizes the PyAesCrypt library for encryption and decryption operations and integrates with the Tkinter library for the GUI. Users can easily encrypt their files and directories by selecting them through the GUI interface, providing a password for encryption. Similarly, they can decrypt encrypted files and directories by selecting them and providing the decryption password. The project also features dynamic button colors, background image support, and audio feedback using the pyttsx3 library.
